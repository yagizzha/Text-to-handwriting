# Text-to-handwriting
takes text and font of your hand writing , puts them in a word document to later be fixed , then does some distortion on it to give a more authentic feel
Start by making fonts , search on web for sites you can use for this 

then use "order.py" and plug your own text and fonts 

after the output change every ^px^ with blank "" 

after that convert it to pdf then to png or any image and put it in to "toimg.py"
